  /// @brief Enum of the standard function return value
  ///
  ///  Generally if a function can fail then it should return one of these values
  ///  to indicate success or failure of the operation. Note that RESULT_OK is
  ///  defined as zero, so any non-zero value indicates an error.
  ///
  ///  Result names should be generic so that they can be reused across many
  ///  diverse classes. When choosing which value to return for a given function,
  ///  the idea is that the Result name should distinguish between the possible
  ///  return values and be reasonably mnemonic, but need not describe the error in
  ///  detail. The details about exactly what it means when a particular Result
  ///  name is returned by a given function should be specified in the comments
  ///  above the function's declaration.
